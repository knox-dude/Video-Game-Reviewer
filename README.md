# Video-Game-Reviewer

This project aims to webscrape game reviews from IGN, Gamefaqs, Gamespot, Kotaku, Polygon, Metacritic, PCgamer, Destructoid, GamesRadar+, Game Informer, Nintendo Life, Christ Centered Gamer, Game Rant, PCWordl, and Steam and use that data to monitor for extraordinary games that my friends and I can get.

Possible scaling options:
- Making user profiles to log games that you've enjoyed
- Filter by platform, genre, etc.
